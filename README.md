FHV Room Searcher
===========

This desktop application allows searching for unoccupied rooms in the [FH Vorarlberg - University of Applied Sciences](http://www.fhv.at).
Currently students have to search for unoccupied rooms manually by taking a look into all room-specific calendars available via the timetable system.

The main target of the FHV Room Searcher is to provide a search interface to list all unoccupied rooms within a configurable timespan and room range (wing, floor,, configurable list,...).
